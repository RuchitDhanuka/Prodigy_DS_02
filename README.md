# **Data Analysis Project**
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis process performed on a sample dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, pivot tables, grouping, various visualizations, and interpretations.

**Introduction**

This project aims to demonstrate the process of data analysis on a sample dataset. It involves various stages, from data cleaning to the final interpretation of results through visualizations.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is a sample dataset containing information about passengers, including their gender, number of siblings per parent, number of parents per child, fare paid, and onboarding station.

**Steps in the Analysis**

**1. Data Cleaning**

Handling missing values.

Removing duplicates.

Formatting and standardizing data.

**2. Data Exploration**

Descriptive statistics.

Understanding data distribution.

Identifying patterns and anomalies.

**3. Pivot Tables**

Creating pivot tables to summarize data.

Analyzing data from different perspectives.

**4. Grouping of Data**

Grouping data by categorical variables such as gender and onboarding station.

Aggregating data to derive meaningful insights.

**5. Visualizations**

Generating various visualizations to illustrate data insights, including:

Bar plots for average siblings per parents and parents per children by gender.

Comparison plots for siblings per parents and parents per children.

Average fare based on gender.

Number of passengers at each onboarding station.

**6. Interpretation**

Detailed interpretation of the visualizations.

Insights on family dynamics, financial differences, and boarding patterns.
